NOTE: This is the first time I reverse engineer a .NET .exe.

- The program is a .NET 4.x program.
- Used dotPeek to decompile it.
- Apparently, it is obfuscated.
- I saw that a resource had high entropy; It had to be encrypted. So searching in the source code I found out that was true.
Also, found a class that has methods to decrypt (the resource).
- Analized and deobfuscated the program.
- Debugged with visual studio and got the flag.
- You can see the decompiled, deobfuscated VS. solution in 'Bypass' folder.
